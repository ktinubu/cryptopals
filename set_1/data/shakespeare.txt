No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
 Give warning to the world that I am fled
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
 Nay if you read this line, remember not,
 The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
 If thinking on me then should make you woe.
 O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
 When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
 But let your love even with my life decay.
 Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
 And mock you with me after I am gone.
 72
 O lest the world should task you to recite,
 What merit lived in me that you should love
 After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
 For you in me can nothing worthy prove.
 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
 To do more for me than mine own desert,
 And hang more praise upon deceased I,
 Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
 O lest your true love may seem false in this,
 That you for love speak well of me untrue,
 My name be buried where my body is,
 And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
 And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
 73
 That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
 When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
 Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
 In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
 As after sunset fadeth in the west,
 Which by and by black night doth take away,
 Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
 As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
 Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
 This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
 To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
 74
 But be contented when that fell arrest,
 Without all bail shall carry me away,
 My life hath in this line some interest,
 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
 When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
 The very part was consecrate to thee,
 The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
 My spirit is thine the better part of me,
 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
 The prey of worms, my body being dead,
 The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
 Too base of thee to be remembered,
 The worth of that, is that which it contains,
 And that is this, and this with thee remains.
 75
 So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Page 21

 Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
 And for the peace of you I hold such strife
 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
 Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
 Now counting best to be with you alone,
 Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
 And by and by clean starved for a look,
 Possessing or pursuing no delight
 Save what is had, or must from you be took.
 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
 Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
 76
 Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
 So far from variation or quick change?
 Why with the time do I not glance aside
 To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
 Why write I still all one, ever the same,
 And keep invention in a noted weed,
 That every word doth almost tell my name,
 Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
 O know sweet love I always write of you,
 And you and love are still my argument:
 So all my best is dressing old words new,
 Spending again what is already spent:
 For as the sun is daily new and old,
 So is my love still telling what is told.
 77
 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
 These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
 And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
 Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
 Time's thievish progress to eternity.
 Look what thy memory cannot contain,
 Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
 Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
 These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
 Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
 78
 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
 And found such fair assistance in my verse,
 As every alien pen hath got my use,
 And under thee their poesy disperse.
 Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
 Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
 And given grace a double majesty.
 Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
 Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
 In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
 But thou art all my art, and dost advance
 As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
 79
 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
 But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
 And my sick muse doth give an other place.
 I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument

 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
 He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
 He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
 From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
 And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
 No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
 Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
 Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
 80
 O how I faint when I of you do write,
 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
 And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
 To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
 But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
 My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
 On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
 Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
 He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
 Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
 The worst was this, my love was my decay.
 81
 Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
 From hence your memory death cannot take,
 Although in me each part will be forgotten.
 Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
 Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
 The earth can yield me but a common grave,
 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
 Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
 Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
 And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
 When all the breathers of this world are dead,
 You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
 Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
 82
 I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
 And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
 The dedicated words which writers use
 Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
 And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
 Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
 And do so love, yet when they have devised,
 What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
 Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
 In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
 And their gross painting might be better used,
 Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
 83
 I never saw that you did painting need,
 And therefore to your fair no painting set,
 I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
 That barren tender of a poet's debt:
 And therefore have I slept in your report,
 That you your self being extant well might show,
 How far a modern quill doth come too short,
 Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
 This silence for my sin you did impute,
Page 23
complete works of william shakespeare.txt
 Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
 For I impair not beauty being mute,
 When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
 Than both your poets can in praise devise.
 84
 Who is it that says most, which can say more,
 Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
 In whose confine immured is the store,
 Which should example where your equal grew.
 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
 That to his subject lends not some small glory,
 But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
 That you are you, so dignifies his story.
 Let him but copy what in you is writ,
 Not making worse what nature made so clear,
 And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
 Making his style admired every where.
 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
 Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
 85
 My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
 While comments of your praise richly compiled,
 Reserve their character with golden quill,
 And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
 I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
 And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
 To every hymn that able spirit affords,
 In polished form of well refined pen.
 Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
 And to the most of praise add something more,
 But that is in my thought, whose love to you
 (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
 Then others, for the breath of words respect,
 Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
 86
 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
 Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
 That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
 Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
 Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
 Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
 No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
 Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
 He nor that affable familiar ghost
 Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
 As victors of my silence cannot boast,
 I was not sick of any fear from thence.
 But when your countenance filled up his line,
 Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
 87
 Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
 And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
 The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
 My bonds in thee are all determinate.
 For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
 And for that riches where is my deserving?
 The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
 And so my patent back again is swerving.
 Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
 Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
 So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
 Comes home again, on better judgement making.
 Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
Page 24

 In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
 88
 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
 And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
 Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
 And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
 With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
 Upon thy part I can set down a story
 Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
 That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:
 And I by this will be a gainer too,
 For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
 The injuries that to my self I do,
 Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
 Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
 That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
 89
 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
 And I will comment upon that offence,
 Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
 Against thy reasons making no defence.
 Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
 To set a form upon desired change,
 As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
 I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
 Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
 Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
 Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
 And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
 For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
 For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
 90
 Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
 Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
 join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
 And do not drop in for an after-loss:
 Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
 Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
 Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
 To linger out a purposed overthrow.
 If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
 When other petty griefs have done their spite,
 But in the onset come, so shall I taste
 At first the very worst of fortune's might.
 And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
 Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
 91
 Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
 Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
 Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
 Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
 Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
 But these particulars are not my measure,
 All these I better in one general best.
 Thy love is better than high birth to me,
 Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
 Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
 And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
 Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
 All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
 92

 But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
 For term of life thou art assured mine,
 And life no longer than thy love will stay,
 For it depends upon that love of thine.
 Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
 When in the least of them my life hath end,
 I see, a better state to me belongs
 Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
 Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
 Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
 O what a happy title do I find,
 Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
 But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
 Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
 93
 So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
 Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
 May still seem love to me, though altered new:
 Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
 For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
 Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
 In many's looks, the false heart's history
 Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
 But heaven in thy creation did decree,
 That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
 Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
 Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
 How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
 94
 They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
 That do not do the thing, they most do show,
 Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
 Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
 They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
 And husband nature's riches from expense,
 Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
 Others, but stewards of their excellence:
 The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
 Though to it self, it only live and die,
 But if that flower with base infection meet,
 The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
 Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
 95
 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
 Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
 Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
 O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
 That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
 (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
 Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
 Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
 O what a mansion have those vices got,
 Which for their habitation chose out thee,
 Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
 And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
 Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
 The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
 96
 Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
 Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
 Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
 Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
Page 26

 As on the finger of a throned queen,
 The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
 So are those errors that in thee are seen,
 To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
 How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
 If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
 How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
 But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
 As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
 97
 How like a winter hath my
